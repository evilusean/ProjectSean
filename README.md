# ProjectSean
A Repository to store all my projects in a centralized location, recently ran into the problem of forgetting how many and what projects I'd actually done(as far as problems go, not a bad one to have)</br>

Just realized how big of an undertaking this is, I have to go through 3 years of code, and sort chronologically every script and project I've done with course dates as well as notes on the projects - a lot of work</br>
I just remembered I already built a chatbot over a year ago, which I forgot about, so I sean the need for this repo.. I've probably forgotten more than I remember at this point</br>

Each project will require:</br>
Start Date / End Date / Tech Used / Project DescriptSean / Summary </br>
What if I just want a quick list? Name + Date - can link to project with further details/summary/descriptsean</br>

Future Sean : Seperate Into 3 parts - By Date - By Course(self directed, tutorial/course) - and by Language</br>
forgot I built a nextJS kanban board and an AI chatbot, going to need to build this before I start applying again, create 2 repos below, and sort the projects
go from start to finish through old commits and go month by month (maybe week? idk) 1 month a day until I am back to today, then it should be 3 easy updates every project I complete to add it to the list
Idk how long it will take me, 3(4?) years of code and commits - dozens of projects - hopefully less than a week, and I can pick the best ones to update my portfolio - kind of want a soft cap of ~6-9(heh) projects
on display - don't want to overwhelm them. 
</br>
By Date (reverse chronological) : </br>
By Language :</br>
Course List + Projects Completed (what projects I did in each course) - and self directed - this can be reverse chronological too:</br>
