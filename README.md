# ProjectSean
A Repository to store all my projects in a centralized location, recently ran into the problem of forgetting how many and what projects I'd actually done(as far as problems go, not a bad one to have)</br>

Just realized how big of an undertaking this is, I have to go through 3 years of code, and sort chronologically every script and project I've done with course dates as well as notes on the projects - a lot of work</br>
I just remembered I already built a chatbot over a year ago, which I forgot about, so I sean the need for this repo.. I've probably forgotten more than I remember at this point</br>

Each project will require:</br>
Start Date / End Date / Tech Used / Project DescriptSean / Summary </br>
What if I just want a quick list? Name + Date - can link to project with further details/summary/descriptsean</br>
